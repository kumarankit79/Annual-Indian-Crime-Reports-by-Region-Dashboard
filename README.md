📊 Annual Indian Crime Reports by Region – Power BI Dashboard

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Indian crime data from 2001 to 2013. The main objective of the project is to understand long-term crime trends in India, identify high-risk states and districts, analyze crimes against women, and compare violent crimes with property and economic crimes in a simple and visual way.

Crime data is often available in raw tables or static reports, which makes it difficult to explore patterns or extract meaningful insights. In this project, the raw dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, then structured into a proper data model to support accurate analysis. Custom DAX measures were created to perform trend analysis, ranking, comparisons, and severity-based insights.

The dashboard is organized into multiple objective-based pages with interactive visuals such as line charts, bar charts, stacked columns, donut charts, matrices, and KPI cards. Users can filter the data using year and state slicers to explore crime patterns across different regions and time periods.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow, from data preparation to insight generation, and was developed as a learning project to strengthen practical skills in Power BI, DAX, data modeling, and data visualization using a real-world public dataset.
